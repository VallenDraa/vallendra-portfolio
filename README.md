# vallendra-portfolio
This is my new portfolio that I remade. Here I will show you a little bit about myself and also showcase the stuff that I've made throughout my journey on programming and web development. Maybe I'll make this site a blog too in the near future.

# Tech Stack
 - Next.js ( I wanted to use React, so I used this so that the SEO is acceptable )
 - Typescript ( Static typing rocks ðŸ¤˜ )
 - MongoDB ( For storing views and likes data for each of the showcase )
 - Tailwind CSS ( A better way to write CSS ðŸ˜Ž)
 - Material Tailwind ( Just wanted to try a component library for building this site )
 - SWR ( Awesome data fetching library especially its revalidate on page focus ðŸ”¥ )

# Features
- Projects and certificates showcase with a detail page for each item
- Comment system that is using github discussion with giscus
- Guestbook for visitors to leave messages (link is located in the site footer)
- Dark and Light mode
- Custom animate on scroll and data lazy loading with Intersection Observer API
- Some easter eggs ðŸ¥š
